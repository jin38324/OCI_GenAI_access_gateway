**Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI Service** is a fully managed service that integrates these versatile language models into a variety of use cases.

Oracle has released SDK that makes it easy to call OCI Generative AI services. However, for many packaged projects, some code modification is required to integrate the OCI Generative AI services.

Due to the wide application of OpenAI services, its API interface format has been supported by the vast majority of AI applications. In order to speed up application integration, a project has been created to make OCI Generative AI services compatible with the OpenAI API.

With this project, you can quickly integrate any application that supports a custom OpenAI interface without modifying the application.

**Oracle 云基础设施 (OCI) 生成式 AI** 是一种完全托管的服务，可将这些多功能语言模型集成到各种用例中。

Oracle已经发布了SDK，可以方便地调用OCI生成式AI服务。但是对于很多已经包装好的项目，需要一些代码修改工作量，以集成OCI上的生成式AI服务。

由于OpenAI服务的广泛应用，其API接口格式已经被绝大多数AI应用所支持。为了能够加快应用集成，一个使OCI生成式AI服务兼容OpenAI API的项目被创建。

通过此项目，您可以在不修改应用的情况下，快速集成任何支持自定义OpenAI接口的应用程序。

# Quick Start


1. Clone this repository;

2. Finish prerequisites, follow [Set Prerequisites](#set-prerequisites) ；

3. Run this app:

    ## Option 1: Launch on host

   In directory `./app`

   run uvicorn:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    
    or use `gunicorn` to enable `parallel threads` (only support linux):
   
   ```bash
   gunicorn app:app --workers 4 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --timeout 600 --bind 0.0.0.0:8088
   ```

    ## Option 2: Launch in docker

    Make sure the `key_file` parameter in user's directory `~/.oci/config` is `~/.oci`, where config and private key located.

    ```bash
    docker build -t oci_genai_gateway .

    docker run -p 8088:8088 \
            -v ~/.oci:/root/.oci \
            -it oci_genai_gateway
			-n oci_genai_gateway
    ```

4. Config your application, set `API Key` and `Host`， like this:

    (This is an example in Cherry Studio)
    
    ![alt text](image/settings.png)

    It's OK now!

# Set Prerequisites

## 1. Install python packages
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 2. Set authentication
Create access authentication for OCI. There are two ways to achieve this:
- Use API Key. This need a little effort, but easy to understand and can be used everywhere
- Use instance principal. This is easy to set but only available on OCI host machines.

**Option1: Use API Key**    

create config file on OCI console, follow this [SDK and CLI Configuration File](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm).

Set `config.py` file, point to your config location,like `OCI_CONFIG_FILE = "~/.oci/config"`.

**Option2: Use instance principal setting**

Set [OCI policy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policieshow/Policy_Basics.htm), define
```
allow dynamic-group <xxxx> to manage generative-ai-family in tenancy
```
xxxx is your dynamic-group that indicated your vm or other resources

in `config.py`, set `AUTH_TYPE=INSTANCE_PRINCIPAL`

## Setting models

### Easy mode through Environment variables

You can set environment variables to use the model.
Below is minimal required environment variables, more settings can be found in [Other settings](#Other settings).

On windows Powershell:
```bash
$env:OCI_REGION="us-chicago-1"
$env:OCI_COMPARTMENT = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaxxxxxx"
```

On linux:
```bash
export OCI_REGION="us-chicago-1"
export OCI_COMPARTMENT = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaxxxxxx"
```



### Advance mode through models.py

If you want to call models in different regions or compartments, you can modify the `models.yaml` file.

Generative AI is a rapidly evolving field, with new models being added and old models being retired.
So I abandoned hard-coding model information in the code and instead defined the model through `models.yaml`.

Don't worry, most of the models have been written well in the file, you just need to use them.

**You can change your `models.yaml` in your runtime if new models are avaliable.**

You can define 4 types of models:
- **ondemand**: pre-trained chat model provided by OCI generative AI service, accessed through a unified API.
- **embedding**: pre-trained embedding model provided by OCI generative AI service, accessed through a unified API.
- **dedicated**: OCI Generative AI service’s proprietary model, the model to be accessed is determined by specifying the endpoint
- **datascience**: LLM service deployed through the [AI ​​Quick Action function of OCI Data Science](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/ai-quick-actions.htm).
AI Quick Actions makes it easy for you to browse foundation models, and deploy, fine-tune, and evaluate them inside Data Science notebooks.
The model to be accessed is determined by specifying the endpoint, and endpoint should be end with `/predict`. 
When create datascience deployment `Inference mode`should be `/v1/chat/completions`.`Inference container` should be `VLLM`.

Model information parameters:
- `region`: OCI services can be provided by multiple regions, so you can configure the region to be called
- `compartment_id`: Required, this parameter determines the compartment where the service is initiated, which is basically related to cost and permission management;
- `name`: is a custom name, a legal string is fine
- `model_id`: is the [standard model ID](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/pretrained-models.htm)
- `endpoint`: Call endpoint, which can be viewed through the OCI console

## Other settings:

These settings has default values, you can modify the `config.py` file to change default settings.

# Test the application

## Set base_url

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key = "ocigenerativeai",
    base_url = "http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8088/v1/",
    )
models = client.models.list()
for model in models:
    print(model.id)
```
